# SimpleDHT
This project is a part of CSE 486/586 Distributed Systems at University at Buffalo 

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will design a simple DHT based on Chord. Although the design is based on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord; you do not need to implement finger tables and finger-based routing; you also do not need to handle node leaves/failures.Therefore, there are three things you need to implement: 1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning, 2) Ring-based routing, and 3) Node joins.

Just like the previous assignment, your app should have an activity and a content provider. However, the main activity should be used for testing only and should not implement any DHT functionality. The content provider should implement all DHT functionalities and support insert and query operations. Thus, if you run multiple instances of your app, all content provider instances should form a Chord ring and serve insert/query requests in a distributed fashion according to the Chord protocol.
